"""Provides substitute for Pygame's "event" module using gtkEvent

Provides methods which will be substituted into Pygame in order to 
provide the synthetic events that we will feed into the Pygame queue.
These methods are registered by the "install" method.

This event queue does not support getting events only of a certain type. 
You need to get all pending events at a time, or filter them yourself. You 
can, however, block and unblock events of certain types, so that may be 
useful to you. 

Set_grab doesn't do anything (you are not allowed to grab events). Sorry.

Extensions:

    wait( timeout=None ) -- allows you to wait for only a specified period 
        before you return to the application.  Can be used to e.g. wait for a 
        short period, then release some resources, then wait a bit more, then
        release a few more resources, then a bit more...
